# House-Prediction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other related attributes. We will use the Linear Regression model to predict house prices, along with Decision Tree Regression for comparison. The results will be displayed in both USD and INR (Indian Rupees) for a global perspective
